# Bulldog

This is a repo that hosts different iterations of a program that simulates a dice game known as Bulldog. The purpose of this project is to compare the outputs of AI tools with regular, man-made code. This is done as a part of course COS 420 at the University of Southern Maine.

## What is Bulldog
The game of Bulldog is played by several players, who each take turns rolling a single six-sided die as many times as they wish, adding all of their roll results to a running total.
However, if the player rolls a 6, the player loses their score for that turn. The game ends when any player's score is greater than or equal to the winning score, which is 104 points by default.
